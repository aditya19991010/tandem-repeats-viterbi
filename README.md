# tandem-repeats-viterbi
This project simulates dinucleotide tandem repeats (e.g., ATATAT...) in DNA and models how replication or sequencing errors introduce mutations into these repetitive regions. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is then used to reconstruct the original repeat sequence using the Viterbi algorithm.
